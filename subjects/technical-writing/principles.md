# Principles

1. Keep it concise.
2. Make no assumptions about my prior knowledge.
3. Give me a preview of what we’re doing before getting started (if what we’re doing is complicated).
4. Construct prerequisite knowledge and then build upon it.
5. Progressively disclose just-in-time information as it’s needed - avoid dumps of just-in-case knowledge.
6. Paint a clear high-level picture of how the thing fits into the world, how it works, and the bare-minimum conceptual scaffolding that I need, linking off to detailed resources as-needed (or using footnotes for elaboration).
7. Don’t force me to click away and come back.
8. Give me an extremely simple, straightforward, linear flow to follow.
9. Provide clear instructions that tell me how to copy/paste/modify the code/commands/configuration that I need.
10. Identify a single "desired result" - optimize the content for "reduced cognitive cost" of confidently achieving it.
11. Assume your reader is an impatient friend whose life depends on completing and understanding the task at hand.
12. “Don’t make me think” - use your “new low-technical user perspective” to minimize jargon and confusion.
13. Give me clear, minimal procedures to follow. Educate me only as much as is needed for me to understand what the procedures are accomplishing.
14. When conveying complex ideas/flows/relationships, visuals can be far more efficient than text.
15. Resist the temptation of clever infrastructure that embeds code snippets from samples repositories into docs. In theory it's a good idea, in practice it distracts from core developer experience improvements, it reduces content iteration frequency, it introduces complexity, dependencies, and risk, and it increases costs. If you do this, make sure you have the engineering resources to do it right (eg Stripe, Twilio).
16. Auto-generating parameter and API reference documentation can be effective, as long as it reduces costs and improves developer experience.
17. Derive titles from current user behavior / search terms / needs.
18. When titling documents, precision and accuracy matter.
19. Expose technical details in docs when technical details are exposed via product.
