# Productivity Waves

Productivity comes in waves. Some days/weeks/months you're full-throttle. Sometimes you're half-throttle or quarter-throttle. Everyone needs space to breathe. Your mind needs time to [assimilate and accommodate](https://www.massey.ac.nz/\~wwpapajl/evolution/assign2/DD/theory.html) - your spirit needs time to dream.&#x20;

It's possible to be full-throttle 100% of the time, but the probability of achieving consistent high-performance in approximately the right direction increases as you allow yourself to cycle through waves of productivity. Those waves are different for everyone, and they change over time.\

This relates to the value of biasing towards intrinsic motivation whenever possible. I've found that following the impulses of my intrinsic motivation keeps me gliding through productivity waves in a way that feels way more sustainable than holding myself accountable to rigid frameworks and expectations.

This manner of work keeps me fluidly shifting from one objective to the next, minimizing the time spent "overcoming resistance and friction", maximizing the time spent in flow state.&#x20;

If you don't feel like doing something, there's probably a good reason for that, and the thing that you do feel like doing is probably "more right" for some good reasons. This isn't meant to diminish the value of discipline - it just suggests that discipline is more valuable when it feels right.
