# Productivity Waves

Productivity comes in waves. Some days/weeks/months you're full-throttle. Sometimes you're half-throttle or quarter-throttle. Everyone needs space to breathe. Your mind needs time to [assimilate and accommodate](https://www.massey.ac.nz/\~wwpapajl/evolution/assign2/DD/theory.html) - your spirit needs time to wander, dream, and discover.

It's possible to be full-throttle 100% of the time, but the probability of achieving consistent high-performance in approximately the right direction increases as you allow yourself to cycle through waves of productivity. Those waves are different for everyone, and they change over time.\

This idea relates to the value of biasing towards [intrinsic motivation](https://psychology.pressbooks.tru.ca/chapter/11-2-theories-of-motivation/) whenever possible. Following the impulses of my intrinsic motivation feels way more sustainable than holding myself accountable to rigid frameworks and expectations. Intrinsic motivation feels like riding a wave - extrinsic motivation feels more like trying to catch a wave. It feels less efficient.

Intrinsic impulse keeps me fluidly shifting from one objective to the next, minimizing the time spent "overcoming resistance and friction", maximizing the time spent in flow state.

One benefit of this strategy is that you don't have to comply with rigid schedules of productivity. A possible drawback is that you may end up "working" on nights, weekends, holidays - whenever you feel pulled towards an objective.

If you don't feel like doing something, there's probably a good reason for that, and the thing that you do feel like doing is probably "more right" for some good reasons.
