### Principles of Constructive Criticism

{% hint style="info" %}
Remote teams often rely on async communication, where innocent statements can be easily interpreted as harsher than intended.\
\
There’s both **business** value (improved collaborative efficiency / increased motivation) and **psychological** value (warm, friendly camaraderie) in taking time to communicate gently. The principles in this section can help minimize the risk of costly communication misfires.

1. **Constructive criticism** is criticism that builds upon someone’s effort while making them feel like their effort is valued. This takes time, tact, and effort, but it can help minimize the risk of demotivating the wonderful people that you work with.
2. When in doubt, consider framing your feedback in terms of **questions** and **feelings**.
   1. “Why was x decision made?”, “Have you considered y?”, “This feels z to me… thoughts?”
3. Assume everyone has a need to feel valued and respected.
4.  An invitation to provide feedback is a **bid** for your intellectual attention. Bid responses generally fall into one of two categories:

    1. **Attending:** This includes constructive criticism, nonviolent communication, thoughtful exploration, praise, appreciation, building-upon - an attempt to intellectually _construct_ towards team/business/user value.
    2. **Ignoring/criticizing/dismissing**: This is expensive because it can negatively impact individual psychology, which can negatively impact group psychology.

    The more we respond to bids through **attendance**, the deeper our connections will be, and the more motivated we’ll be to collaboratively build value.
5. Focus less on format/voice and more on the core ideas being presented.
6. If you don’t have something constructive to add, don’t say anything at all.
7. If someone invests effort into presenting an idea, consider reciprocating that effort by reviewing and thinking about their perspective carefully, instead of just skimming and thin-slicing.
   1. If an idea’s presentation is too verbose, a gentle request for a TLDR could help → “I’m super distracted at the moment, would it be possible to distill this into a paragraph?”
   2. If you don't have time to provide thoughtful constructive criticism, expressing this constraint can help soften reception -> "I'm admittedly super constrained, but my initial impressions are x. Please take this with a grain of salt though - I haven't had time to review and reflect in detail!"
8. Ask questions about alternatives instead of imploring/demanding/commanding.
   1. "do X" -> "why is it this way? thoughts on this other way?"
9. Avoid flippant dismissals - attempt to make the person feel understood and respected.
   1. If you think an idea/approach is flawed → “Why is this person doing what they’re doing? How can I help them help us all, without making them feel negative emotions?”
10. Ask questions before suggesting big changes or rejecting a proposal.
    1. “Let me spit this back at you to make sure I understand your thinking - the way that I understand this is xyz, is that right?” → This communicates a good-faith effort to “understand first”.
11. Offer solutions when communicating perceived problems.
    1. “X is bad” → “X feels suboptimal because Y. Am I understanding that correctly? Have we considered Z?”
12. Sandwich proposed solutions in positive feedback when communicating perceived problems.
    1. “X is bad” → “I love X about this - I can tell you've put a lot of thought into it. One aspect that feels suboptimal is Y because Z... Am I understanding things correctly? If so, a potential way to address Y is W... how does this feel to you? Thank you for asking me for inputs - I really love the direction this is headed in!” -> It's less terse and more expensive in the short-term, but also healthier psychology (which can reduce costs) over the long-term.
13. Praise, encouragement, and **constructive** criticism can be shared in public, but harsher or blunter criticism is usually best offered privately. Everyone lives somewhere on the spectrum of sensitivity, and folks on one end of that spectrum may be easily overwhelmed or demotivated by the anxiety that can accompany public criticism.
